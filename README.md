# Weekly Reports

## Week One
Have been having heated discussions about which of our movement systems to use, after play testing the split of what people liked was very close leaving us unsure as to which one is best. The group is split and it's been a dragged out process. I’ve decided to step back from it as I believe both options will be acceptable and I have been worrying while at home that I haven’t been flexible enough for the team. Though I have been open to both its become just 2 sides claiming one option will be better. Other than that this week has been exciting finding out about all the modules for this study block as they mostly things i am interested in doing.
Friday I worked from home as Indi wasn’t working and i had no lectures, however this left me without people to ask for assistance when getting stuck which slowed my work down.

## Week Two
I found the discussion about the differing movement systems to be a circle of never ending pain. The team was split half and half on the two systems and through playtesting we saw that so were our players. The topic had become quite heated and it was getting to me that it’s possible some of the team members may have been getting upset about it. So i decided to step back and no longer engage in the discussion as where i stood on the topic is known to the team.

## Week Five


## Week Six
Considerations about the 3rd year teams are becoming more prevalent, my current team would like to stay together. I do like the team and have decided to stay with them however it has now become a problem in that one team member has not really had the correct work ethic and carrying them through the next year would be annoying. I have talked privately with a few members to see if they agree and it’s feeling like we now need to check with everyone on how they feel. Dealing with this is a sensitive matter.

## Week Seven
Show and tell was as always tedious but impressive. Have been focusing a lot on personal work as a couple of deadlines are coming up. It’s tricky having to say no when the team wants some work done but i’m in the middle of working.
