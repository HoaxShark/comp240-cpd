# Weekly Reports

## Week One
Have been having heated discussions about which of our movement systems to use, after play testing the split of what people liked was very close leaving us unsure as to which one is best. The group is split and it's been a dragged out process. I’ve decided to step back from it as I believe both options will be acceptable and I have been worrying while at home that I haven’t been flexible enough for the team. Though I have been open to both its become just 2 sides claiming one option will be better. Other than that this week has been exciting finding out about all the modules for this study block as they mostly things i am interested in doing.
Friday I worked from home as Indi wasn’t working and i had no lectures, however this left me without people to ask for assistance when getting stuck which slowed my work down.

## Week Two
I found the discussion about the differing movement systems to be a circle of never ending pain. The team was split half and half on the two systems and through playtesting we saw that so were our players. The topic had become quite heated and it was getting to me that it’s possible some of the team members may have been getting upset about it. So i decided to step back and no longer engage in the discussion as where i stood on the topic is known to the team.

## Week Three
I've been doing well to avoid getting involved in circle talks to save my own sanity

## Week Four
The art style of a lot of the current assets doesn't really feel like its working with the plan of what we wanted, not sure how to go about mentioning this.

## Week Five
people are worrying about show and tell already, I'm not that bothered by it, other than the fact that i have to sit in clap land for the day, otherwise might be alright.

## Week Six
Considerations about the 3rd year teams are becoming more prevalent, my current team would like to stay together. I do like the team and have decided to stay with them however it has now become a problem in that one team member has not really had the correct work ethic and carrying them through the next year would be annoying. I have talked privately with a few members to see if they agree and it’s feeling like we now need to check with everyone on how they feel. Dealing with this is a sensitive matter.

## Week Seven
Show and tell was as always tedious but impressive. Have been focusing a lot on personal work as a couple of deadlines are coming up. It’s tricky having to say no when the team wants some work done but i’m in the middle of working.

## Week Eight
feels like team moral has died a bit after show and tell, people are starting to not be around hopefully this bounces back

## Week Nine
Everyone on the team was set on kicking out the guy that was under performing for next year, annoying thing is he has very recently been stepping up his game a little. I changed my opinion to neutral because of this change but it looks like it may be too little too late.

## Week Ten
Been working all easter, did take a couple days off, the studio is so nice and quiet, wonder if it can be like this everyday

## Week Eleven
Found out about an internship, gotta spam out a portfolio, would have been really hand to have had one in advance. Reminds me to have to make a twitter and linked in account

## Week Twelve
work work work, I feel like i've used my time well and will get everything done on time, but it still feels a bit stressful at this time of year.
